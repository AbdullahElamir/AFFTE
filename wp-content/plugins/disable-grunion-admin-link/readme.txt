Unfortunately, the Grunion Contact Form plugin has been discontinued by the original developers of the plugin. Due to this, the disable Grunion Admin Link plugin has also been discontinued. The current version is the last which will be released. At the time of writing this (December 2014), this plugin was still functioning and usable, but the actual Grunion Contact Form plugin was grossly out of date. Sadly, we do not recommend using this plugin any longer. As an alternative, you may wish to look into the <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms plugin</a> which offers many more features, although without the beautiful simplicity of the Grunion plugin.


The <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/">Grunion Contact Form plugin</a> for WordPress is one of the best contact form plugins around. It is far simpler to use than it’s more popular rivals such as Contact Form 7 and Gravity Forms and is used by the largest WordPress powered website of them all, WordPress.com.

<strong>However</strong> … some of you may not like the addition of an extra link in your WordPress admin menu which this new version includes. So to avoid this problem, you can simply install the “Disable Grunion Admin link” plugin to have that extra admin menu link replaced with a less obtrusive one which can be found under "Dashboard".

After you've downloaded and extracted the files:

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The feedbacks link should now be remove from your admin menu.

Thanks to the developers of the original Grunion Contact form plugin. It is unfortunate they decided to kill of a great little plugin.
